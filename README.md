## 🚧 Project Status
🐋
**ORCat** is currently in ~~**active development**~~ **Slowed**.  
While the compiler core is functional, work is ongoing on:

- 🧱 Standard library development  
- 🧬 Language feature polish  
- ⚙️ Runtime and performance enhancements

The syntax has been fully built and is being iterated on.

## Memory ownership (important)

- Many stdlib functions return heap-allocated C strings (e.g. `read_file`, `input`, `tostring`, `sb_*`, `i64tostr`, `ftostr`). These are owned by the caller and **must** be freed via `free_str()` in Orcat.
- Some helpers (like `get_os()` / `get_os_max_bits()` in older versions) returned static pointers. After the 2025-10-31 patch, all string-returning functions used by Orcat return allocated strings to avoid undefined behavior — callers can `free_str()` safely. If you maintain exceptions, document them here.

## 📌 Quick Notes

- This is a “small” but VERY ambitious compiler project.
- Designed with extensibility as a top priority
- *(because I do not like compiled languages that slap the dev for doing something harmless),
- safety, and simplicity in a language.
