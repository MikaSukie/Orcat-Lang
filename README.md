## 🚧 Project Status
🐋
**ORCat** is currently in **active development**.  
While the compiler core is functional, work is ongoing on:

- 🧱 Standard library development  
- 🧬 Language feature polish  
- ⚙️ Runtime and performance enhancements

The syntax has been fully built and is being iterated on.

## 📌 Quick Notes

- This is a “small” but VERY ambitious compiler project.
- Designed with extensibility as a top priority
- *(because I do not like compiled languages that slap the dev for doing something harmless),
- safety, and simplicity in mind.

Stay tuned for more updates! 🌟
